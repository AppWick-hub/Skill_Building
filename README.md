# Introduction
Here I am going to upload all the materials related to R, Python and shell scripting with respect to working on Bioinformatics and diverse area of Statistics (Geospatial analysis+Machine learning+Deep Learning). With the increasing amount of data, its very important to learn the cloud computing and data management in server (which is not covered here but, it would be useful if one can learn these skills side by side). 

Also I will update here about some courses to take to learn the mentioned topics using R and Python completely.
