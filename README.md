# Introduction
Here I am going to upload all the materials related to R, Python and shell scripting with respect to working on Bioinformatics and diverse area of Statistics (Geospatial analysis+Machine learning+Deep Learning). Also I will update here about some courses to take to learn the mentioned topics using R and Python completely.
